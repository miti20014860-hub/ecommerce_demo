    "description": "Habaki is a family-owned katana maker and trader with over four generations of expertise, rooted in a proud heritage dating back to the early 1900s in Kyoto. Founded by master swordsmith Takemura Haruki, we specialize in crafting authentic katanas using the finest materials and time-honored techniques, blending tradition with precision to create blades of exceptional quality and beauty.\r\n\r\nOur swords begin with premium tamahagane steel, carefully folded and forged to reveal the unique grain pattern known as hada. This process removes impurities and enhances the blade’s strength, flexibility, and sharpness. Our skilled swordsmiths then apply a traditional differential hardening technique to produce the signature hamon—the distinctive, wavy temper line symbolizing the blade’s superior cutting edge.\r\n\r\nEach katana undergoes expert polishing to highlight its grain and sharpness, while our artisans handcraft the fittings—the handle, guard, and scabbard—with authentic materials and intricate designs that honor samurai culture. This meticulous attention to detail ensures that every sword we produce is both a functional weapon and a work of art.\r\n\r\nIn addition to crafting new blades, Habaki offers a curated selection of rare and antique katanas, carefully authenticated and restored for collectors and enthusiasts worldwide.\r\n\r\nAt Habaki, we honor the spirit of the samurai by preserving the artistry and legacy of the katana, delivering blades that inspire respect, pride, and admiration for generations to come.",
