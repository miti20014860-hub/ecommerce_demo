      "description": "The Meiji Restoration marked the end of the samurai era, placing Japanese swords in jeopardy. Amid such upheaval, it is an undeniable fact that Japanese sword culture has been passed down to the present day thanks to the efforts of Emperor Meiji, who valued the preservation of the history and traditions of Japanese swords and the passing on of sword techniques.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the Reiwa era, the value of Japanese swords is widely recognized both at home and abroad, and they are highly acclaimed as works of art.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 2022, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Emperor Meiji's death and the 170th anniversary of his birth, our association honored the Emperor Meiji's achievements, who had a profound impact on the revival of Japanese sword culture, by forging a sword at the Meiji Jingu Treasure House on November 3rd, a day closely associated with the enshrined deity. Furthermore, we held a \"Japanese Sword Craftsmanship Exhibition\" for 21 days, including the annual festival day, showcasing the connection between Emperor Meiji and Japanese sword culture, providing a valuable opportunity to convey its appeal to many people.\r\n\r\nNow, after three years, we are once again holding the \"Japanese Sword Mastery Exhibition,\" which brings together masterpieces, mainly works by contemporary swordsmiths.",
