                    (A-6) Upon exporting a “registered” sword from Japan, we will have to inform the “Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs -(J.A.C.A.)” and apply for an “export permit for antiques”. Once the documents have been issued and attached to the sword it is usually shipped about 2 weeks later.

                    (A-7) We usually use “EMS” for standard shipping, upon sending the item abroad. Shipping expenses for items with a length of more than 150cm, or items which weigh more than a “standard sword” (i.e. a spear, armour, muskets and such), will be charged an extra ￥40,000,-(JPY). A similar case applies, if Fedex is preferred over EMS. Standard shipping + insurance is included in the item’s price. *4
